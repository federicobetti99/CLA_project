# Estimating the diagonal of the inverse
 
This repository contains the numerical experiments for the `Estimating the diagonal of the inverse` project, carried out in the context of the MATH-453 Computational Linear Algebra course at EPFL.

## Repository description
- `code` - Implementation of the experiments
  - `utils` - Subfolder with utilities functions
  - `lanczos_mc.m` - Main script for Lanczos MC estimator
  - `lanczos.m` - Main script for Lanczos estimator
  - `mc.m` - Main script for MC estimator
  - `main.m` - Main script to run all the experiments
- `figures` - Plots of the obtained results
- `matrices` - Folder containing the matrices used in the experiments in `.mat` format

## Reproducibility of the results
We provide a unique Matlab script `main.m` to reproduce the results shown in the report. The latter produces the plots presented in the report in the same order as they appear in the latter.
